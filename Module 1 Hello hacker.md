# Module 1: Hello Hacker

### `whoami` command

### `hello` command
The `hello` command is a custom command provided by the environment on the pwn.college platform.<br>
It is used here for just giving introduction to commands and arguments.<br>
All commands are case sensetive, which means `hello` can not be written as `Hello`

## Challenge-1:
In this challenge we just have to execute `hello` command. By executing it we get the flag.<br><br>
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8ECt4C05JgTyIn8sHKVZPR6ACKX.ddjNyUDL2EjN0czW}
```

### `echo` command
It just display the argument passed to it in the terminal. It can have multiple arguments.<br>

## Challenge-2:
In this challenge we have to give command `hello` with single argument which is `hackers`. <br>So the full command should be `hello hackers` which gives the flag<br><br>
`flag: pwn.college{sQKAELQAlf1ot2gJMjNfcc9JANU.dhjNyUDL2EjN0czW}`
