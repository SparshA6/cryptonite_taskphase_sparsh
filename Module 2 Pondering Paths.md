# Module 2: Pondering Paths

## Challenge-1: The Root
In this challenge we have to invoke a program by giving its absolute path.<br>
Absolute path starts form `/`, the program name is `pwn` and it is in the root directory.<br>
so the command would be `/pwn` this is the absolute path of pwn program<br>
which means run the program `pwn` which is inside the root directory

```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Y8RFssG2WH3l6HXi3wf98Dskanb.dhzN5QDL2EjN0czW}
```

## Challenge-2: Program and Absolute path
In this challenge we have to invoke `run` program which is inside `challenge` folder and the `challenge` folder is in root directory.<br> 
So, the absolute path will be `/challenge/run`
```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0CJQSL09ICL6SMCjpFmukOh4BU3.dVDN1QDL2EjN0czW}
```
